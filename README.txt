Compile using:
	make

Notes:
	1. Overflow is not handled. It is expected the user use types with enough bits to hold a multiplication result.
	2. Data types must match; i.e. casting between matrices is not handled.
	3. Extensions to the project are noted with TODO in the header file
	4. More details on tests can be found in gen_tests.py
